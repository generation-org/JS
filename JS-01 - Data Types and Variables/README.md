## Part 2:  New contender

Complete each challenge individually. Use all resources available. 

### Challenge 1: Create an Age Calculator

Store your birth year in a variable.
Store a future year in another variable. 
Calculate your possible ages for the future year and display it in the console. 
Example: If you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you’ll be 37 or 38 (depending on the month in 2026).



### Challenge 2: Create an information card

Create a card holding 3 pieces of information about a person, such as Name, Location, and Hobby.
Each piece of information should be a variable.
Display the card with the information in the correct place.
Example: “Hi, my name is John. I live in South Africa and enjoy drinking homemade wine.”
